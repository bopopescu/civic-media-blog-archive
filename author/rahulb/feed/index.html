The norms, &#8220;canonical&#8221; readings, and the cutting edge evolve every month! With such an evolving landscape to work within, I relish the opportunities I have to explore something new and different with students in a focused way. This past week I had the great pleasure of doing precisely that at the invitation of the FHNW Institute of Industrial Design as part of their International Design Workshop. The week, which reminded [&#8230;]]]></description>

Data scientists and policy makers are usually the only ones with the expertise to engage with data. If we want to empower others to find and tell stories with data, we need to create new ways to engage with information. Over the past decade, we have been exploring community engagement in a variety of creative ways, [&#8230;]]]></description>

As more of our society is shaped by data-driven systems it is up to us to come up with more relatable and comprehensible representations of those data and processes.&#160;I believe data sculptures have a unique power in this response because of the way they engage people in space with [&#8230;]]]></description>

Are you optimistic or pessimistic about data as a tool for good in the world? Over the last few years I’ve seen the shift in answers to this questions. People used to answer “optimistic”, but now most people indicate some mix of emotions. You’ve probably seen the Gartner hype cycle with its suggestion that a technology receives inflated [&#8230;]]]></description>

Sadly these algorithms aren’t creating a more neutral world of equitable outcomes; they are baking in historical injustices long present in society at large (1). Not surprisingly, those who are currently denied power in society are the most at-risk in this data driven future. Their voices should be amplified and set the agenda.

They&#8217;ve increasingly centralized and have radically altered the idea of the &#8220;web&#8221; for hundreds of millions around the globe. Black-box algorithms govern what users see on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, with no mechanisms or accountability for their real world impacts. This has led to waves of backlash against these platforms, with the media and policymakers pursuing them with pitchforks. It doesn&#8217;t have to be [&#8230;]]]></description>

In case you missed it, the recording and transcript are now online! We gave a quick background on the Data Culture Project.

For some individuals, this means jumping into tools like Excel, Tableau, programming, or R Studio. But what does this mean for a group of people that work together? We often talk about data literacy as if it’s an individual capacity, but what about data literacy for a community? How does an organization learn [&#8230;]]]></description>
