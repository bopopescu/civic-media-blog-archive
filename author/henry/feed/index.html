					<description><![CDATA[Cross-posted with henryjenkins.org. Henry Jenkins: On September 20 2007, we officially launched the MIT Center for the Future of Civic Media, a joint venture of the Media Lab and the Comparative Media Studies Program. Our launching event include myself, Chris Csikzentmihalyi, Mitchell Resnick, Beth Noveck, and Ethan Zuckerman. At the time, Chris, Mitch and I were the co-directors of the Center. It was announced several months ago that Ethan Zuckerman would now be taking over [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, Adam Fish called me out through his blog, Savage Minds, for what he saw as a harsh and unfair representation of the Media Reform movement in the final paragraphs of my book, Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide. He did so for the most part by simply reprinting my own words to frame a story he wrote about the recent Media Reform conference. I was a bit surprised to [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What do these news comedy programs add to our understanding of contemporary life which may be missing from mainstream news? What these programs excel at is deconstructing the scripted quality of the contemporary political conversation. Though we may be aware that politicians and corporate spokespeople are all carefully groomed and staged, and that their PR people are experts at getting the talking points on television, the news media rarely actually point this out, nor do [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In case anyone was wondering, I&#8217;m not dead&#8230;yet. I seem to have spent the past few weeks AWOL on this blog, having gotten my rhythm thrown off over a particular intense period of activity on my part. Every day, I&#8217;ve been deluding myself into thinking I&#8217;d jump back into the swing of things, and I&#8217;ve been busy planning some really cool stuff for the summer which I will be announcing soon, but I&#8217;ve been silent.

					<description><![CDATA[For those of you interested in the work I&#8217;ve been discussing over the past week or so on civics and participatory culture, let me strongly recommend checking out the blog which is being run by the graduate students associated with our CivicPaths research group. Recent discussions there have included considerations of zombies as potential political metaphors, reflections on the nature of &#8220;engaged scholarship,&#8221; thoughts on what we can learn from the Tea Party movement, and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You write near the end of the book, &#8220;While the Obama Administration and other black officials are attempting to avoid discussions of race, members of the Republican Party and the Far Right have escalated their racial and racist talks and attacks. These contrasting trends have meant that racial discouse is increasingly being shaped by, or at least framed by, the right wing.&#8221; Clearly, you have in mind something like the Tea Party movement. How would [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have mentioned here several times before my participation in a new research network on youth and participatory politics, which has been funded and organized by the MacArthur Foundation as an extension of their work on Digital Media and Learning. Part of the pleasures of participating in this network has been the chance to engage in &#8220;mixed methods&#8221; research and in the process, to learn more about research methods that previously seemed very alien to [&#8230;]]]></description>
