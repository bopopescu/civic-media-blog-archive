					<description><![CDATA[Looking back at my first blog post, I defined civic media as: Civic media is any use of a medium that empowers a community to engage within and beyond the people, places, and problems of their community. I then explained what I meant by a medium, a community, engagement, people, places, and problems. (I realize that I didn&#8217;t describe what I meant by empower though!) I still stand by this definition, but I believe this [&#8230;]]]></description>

Focusing on Real-Life Community Issues In a past project update, we surveyed a number of cases in the Scratch Online Community where Scratch members expressed civic engagement through the interactive media projects they shared. One of our research questions asks, “When young people use a media creation and sharing community to engage in civic discourse and expression with their community [&#8230;]]]></description>

For our Intro to Civic Media final project, we are exploring the ways in which young people are expressing their civic engagement through the interactive media they’ve created and shared in the Scratch Online Community.

					<description><![CDATA[For Intro to Civic Media this week we were asked to pick a media news outlet and examine how they incorporated participatory media into their practices and work. Being a regular New York Times reader, I decided to look back at my own personal observations of the NYTimes&#8217; online interaction with readers. When thinking of examples within the NYTimes website, I kept going back to their blogs, which are managed and written by their staff [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After reading Uricchio&#8217;s analysis of the maturation of the film industry and the debates across national and cultural boundaries to situate it, I was reminded about the rise of video games and its own cultural debates and shifts. What triggered this example was the military&#8217;s use of video games as a recruitment tool with American Army, a multiplayer networked game under the first player shooting game genre. While it is no longer in active development [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post is a summary of our class discussion on September 19, 2011 on Dialogic Approaches: From Public Sphere to Networked Counterpublics facilitated by J. Nathan Matias. Our collaborative class notes are located here. Before our discussion began, we read articles covering the emergence of counterpublic ideas from public sphere theory to what counterpublic means in the networked world. Our discussion began by summarizing these texts and ended by reflecting on how the ideas of [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The tools and resources of the Internet have given rise to &#8220;networked counterpublics&#8221;, spaces mediated by networked tools where individuals of common interests can engage in discourse and action internally and externally with other (perhaps more dominant) public spheres. What it means to be &#8220;counterpublic&#8221;, I believe, has not departed much from what Nancy Fraser defined it &#8211; as &#8220;subaltern&#8221; or coalitions of marginal groups combating oppression from more dominant public spheres. However, as Yochai [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Examining examples and definitions from the Civic Media site and blog posts from various thought leaders, I formed the following definition of Civic Media: Civic Media is any use of a medium that empowers a community to engage within and beyond the people, places, and problems of their community. This definition connects with what I believe are some key principles of civic media: The medium of interaction alone is not enough, but it must be [&#8230;]]]></description>
