					<description><![CDATA[For those of us who miss Henry Jenkins&#8217; familiar figure around the MIT campus, last night&#8217;s Farewell at the MIT Communications Forum was a delight. For those of you who missed it you&#8217;ll just have to wait until the audio and video appear on the Communications Forum website. It&#8217;s worth seeing. The audience reception was the closest thing I&#8217;ve seen to a standing ovation at an MIT talk. Most MIT audiences can&#8217;t stand up since [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[MIT Communications Forum, April 10, 2008 Speakers: Yochai Benkler and Cass Sunstein, moderated by Henry Jenkins Much discussion of our impending digital future is insular and without nuance. Skeptics talk mainly among themselves, while utopians and optimists also keep company mainly within their own tribal cultures. The forum challenges this unhelpful division, staging a conversation between two of our country’s most thoughtful and influential writers on the promise and the perils of the Internet Age.

					<description><![CDATA[A new type of generation gap was in evidence at this year’s Online News Association conference in Toronto last week. The gap was not defined by age in years, but by attitudes toward journalism in a digital age–particularly among experienced (mostly print) journalists who viewed the transition to online news platforms with trepidation. Moving news online was not the problem; interactivity, or engagement with the audience, was. The biggest bogeyman appeared to be “UGC” (acronym [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On Wednesday, the Center for Future Civic Media held a kick-off dinner at the MIT Media Lab to brainstorm youth-related projects. While the Center will engage in a wide range of civic media projects involving people of all ages, a subgroup of researchers are focusing on the talents and enthusiasm of young people. We invited educators who work with youth in local school and after-school settings, and we are offering them an opportunity to help [&#8230;]]]></description>
