For everyone else, data visualization usually takes the form of a diagram on a small, two-dimensional screen. Standard data plots can take an exciting idea and turn it into something boring, or even worse, drudge up memories of panicked high school math exams. This experimental data sculpture attempts to draw the viewer into [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Photo by jordesign The first AlterConf Boston hosted a mix of techies, gamers, and journalists to discuss diversity in these communities. As a self-identified communication-nerd, I was excited for Shauna Gordon-McKeon&#8216;s &#8220;Talking the Talk&#8221; presentation on the role of different communication styles in encouraging diversity inclusion. These notes are from her talk. Gordon-McKeon wants to dispel the myth that arguing is the road to truth, that truth = people + talking &#8211; emotions + data. [&#8230;]]]></description>

Over the weekend, I attended HOPE X, the 10th Hackers on Planet Earth conference, organized by 2600 Magazine. HOPE is my favorite hacker conference, and a strong contender for my favorite conference overall, because although content is tech-heavy, it&#8217;s not really about technology. HOPE is a conference by and for those interested in the hacker ethos of free information, understanding the world, and empowerment to fix what is broken— including keynote [&#8230;]]]></description>

Most of the time, we&#8217;re actually up against small adversaries. Most adversaries are just jerks. Small adversaries target everyone, with whatever technology they have. It might be gossip around the water cooler. It might be local law enforcement, or your IT department, in schools, corporations, or NGOs. They&#8217;re honor killings, partners committing [&#8230;]]]></description>

OpenITP believes that community infrastructure should come from the community. We&#8217;re used to infrastructure like roads: someone else builds and maintains it.
