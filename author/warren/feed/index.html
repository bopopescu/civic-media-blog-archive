					<description><![CDATA[I went down early last week to New Orleans and began coordinating a citizen aerial mapping effort with the Louisiana Bucket Brigade (LABB) using my recent research in low-cost balloon and kite-based aerial imaging. Our efforts have begun to bear fruit, as almost daily trips into the Gulf are bringing back stunning imagery: On Sunday May 9, Stewart Long, Shannon and Mariko from LABB, and several other volunteers made it to the Chandeleur islands on [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The latest C4FCM post from the Idea Lab blog: I&#8217;m getting ready for day five of a two-week workshop for high schoolers at Beaver Country Day School in a suburb of Boston. The subject is my project, Grassroots Mapping, which helps teach people &#8212; often young people &#8212; around the world how to be activist cartographers and how to make their own maps. There&#8217;s a twist, however: Instead of just marking a Google Map, or [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cross-posted at GrassrootsMapping.org Another day, another new grassroots map! After working with residents of Cantagallo at the beginning of February to produce the first map of their community with Daniel Miracle of Escuelab, we met with members of another of the 3 groups of Shipibo living in the same zone in the center of Lima. Upon seeing the maps we&#8217;d made, they were excited to make one also. Sara Gomez of CEDRO, who introduced us [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(The following post is cross-posted at GrassrootsMapping.org) Yesterday Seth Hunter and I had our big flight with teachers from CEDRO and Manzanita &#8220;A&#8221; and the kids from invasion Juan Pablo II, and everything went extremely well. We started by reviewing the Google Maps imagery of the area (see previous post) and discussing their new homework project of writing about the history of the community, when their family arrived and from where, etc. (see the full [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Josh Levinger and I visited the West Bank for a few days following the MobileActive/UNICEF Mobile Data Innovations workshop. (Andrew posted about this last week) We were hoping to meet up with some members of the activist community who are organizing against the growth of Israeli settlements into Palestinian land. As mappers, we hoped to test some new low-cost tools and to learn about how such techniques can support communities in this fundamentally geographic dispute. [&#8230;]]]></description>
