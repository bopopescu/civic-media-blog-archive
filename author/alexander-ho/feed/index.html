					<description><![CDATA[My researching and brainstorming of my final project has taken me into an informal investigation of the nature of commerce and of racial inclusiveness in hip-hop culture. I have recently been looking at two books, “Beyond Resistance”!, (http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Resistance-Activism-Community-Change/dp/041&#8230;) an anthology of different urban youth development and civic engagement projects, edited by Shawn Ginwright, Pedro Noguera, and Julio Cammarota, and “The Tanning of America” (http://tanningofamerica.com/), which is a consumer brand marketer’s account of how hip hop [&#8230;]]]></description>
