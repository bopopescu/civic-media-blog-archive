					<description><![CDATA[Earlier this year I came across a news piece on Wired, about Klout, the company that created a score that ranks people on the internet according to their activity in Social Media, mainly Twitter and Facebook. The piece describes how people gain “points” on their Klout score, according to number of twits, products promotion, etc. Basically, Klout is a market oriented tool, that will use and stimulate peoples activity on social media to promote products.

					<description><![CDATA[On the project workshop session with professor Sasha Costanza-Shock, he suggested the reading of Ian Bogost texts about games and “gamification”, in the light of my final project, which aims to develop a project to create a tool to measure individual civic participation on the web, which I named Civindex. I had never heard the expression “gamification” before, but it seemed to make sense, as there are indeed some game elements in the use of [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great news for the Civindex project. Right after I wrote here about the idea of creating an index to measure personal activist participation on the internet, I received an interesting message on the comments section: “Hi Andre, I came across this interesting post. I found this idea intriguing. I am also conducting some research on similar topics. Why don&#8217;t we have a chat on this?” It turned out to be a message from Stefano de [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Every week one of us is assigned to write a blog about the last Introduction to Civic Media class. So this week is my turn. We started the class reviewing a few of the projects that were presented in this blog the week before. The projects are receiving faculty advice, either personally, through e-mails or blog comments on the posts. Then we went through the theory which, for most of us in class, was very [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In our second Civic Media Class at the MIT we worked on a model that could illustrate the problem of digital exclusion or limitations that make people have different qualities of access to the internet. Our discussion departed from interesting article talking about different factors that influence exclusion. One of them, for example, mapped the access to the internet in different neighborhoods of Los Angeles (Modarres and Pitkin (2006). &#8220;Technology and the Geography of Inequality [&#8230;]]]></description>
