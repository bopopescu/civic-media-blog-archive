I noticed that the account for MIT, where I work as an admissions officer and research affiliate, had tweeted a story about Math Prize for Girls, an annual competition, hosted on campus last weekend, for women with an affinity for STEM. I&#8217;m a longtime fan and supporter of Math Prize. In fact, I had spoken at the competition, giving a [&#8230;]]]></description>

A wartime ban had been placed on American popular music, and so officials were serenaded instead by the popular nationalist songs of the day, including &#8220;Over There,&#8221; a 1939 tribute to the bravery of Japan&#8217;s soldiers—and, unbeknownst to all but a music journalist in attendance, a cover of &#8220;Over There,&#8221; the [&#8230;]]]></description>
