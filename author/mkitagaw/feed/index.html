These outside projects can seamlessly come into the community largely because of two proactive community leaders; at the same time, there is a big gap of interests, passion and efforts between these two leaders and the rest [&#8230;]]]></description>

The community we are currently working with is Tane in Shiga prefecture, which is a rural community facing the depopulation. In SoHub, we are trying to tackle the population challenge through improving the smaller factors (for example agricultural production and housing) of the community &#8211; and this [&#8230;]]]></description>
