					<description><![CDATA[Dan Gillmor is such a smooth writer and so media savvy that we readers hardly realize he is hurling a challenge at all of us, from average citizens to professionals, in his new book, Mediactive, which can be purchased at store and online outlets or can be downloaded at http://mediactive.com. Gillmor identified the phenomenon of &#8220;consumer as creator&#8221; in his first book, We The People, published in 2004. His latest book is a practical, common-sense [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The blog headline read, &#8220;What Works&#8221;. How ironic. It was published the day a community website I was involved with bit the dust after five-plus years. break The blog, written by Jan Schaffer, a respected journalism leader and a new media pioneer, summarized a report on the status of community news websites funded by J-Lab between 2005 and now. Rye Reflections began in June, 2005. We had no funding, nor did we seek any, nor [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Civic media is serious business. Do we need a little more levity? New Media can learn a lot from Old Media about taking ourselves too seriously, a trick that YouTube certainly has caught onto and turned into a franchise. Former newspaper humor columnist Susan Trausch defies her reader to resist laughing aloud in her new book, entitled Groping Toward Whatever -or- How I Learned to Retire [SORT OF], which is about being thrust into early [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#8217;s wrong with this picture: Mainstream media lays off reporters (and others) left and right, because New Media appeals to a large segment of news consumers. New Media realizes local news draws more audience, so numerous hyper-local approaches are tried. Most national attempts fail, because they don&#8217;t have reporters. AOL&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Patch, thinks it can fill the local gap by hiring local journalists who generally are good at aggregating (see story on London lecture [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;The press has done an admirable (albeit belated) job with the technical complexities of MMS&#8217;s (Minerals Management Services of the Interior Department) administrative failings. What is not being asked, and what the press needs to focus on, is whether MMS&#8217;s problems are endemic to the entire federal government.&#8221; From Nieman Watchdog Two stories in the media raised an eyebrow in June: One was a front-page takeout on June 10 in USA Today on adult pools [&#8230;]]]></description>

One tangible example is the UROP program (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program), started in 1969 by the late Prof. Margaret MacVicar, MIT&#8217;s first dean of undergraduate education, who acted on a suggestion by Dr. Edwin H. Land, inventor of instant photography (Polaroid), who believed every student should have a faculty mentor, doing research projects at the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By Jack Driscoll Either a lot of bloggers are modest or their software templates are doing them a disservice. Like a lot of surfers, I have favorite blogs that I read regularly, but I also look at few most days using that mysterious approach known as random selection. I&#8217;m moving fast, as is our wont on the web. And a high percentage of the time I&#8217;m unable or hard-pressed to find out who the author [&#8230;]]]></description>
