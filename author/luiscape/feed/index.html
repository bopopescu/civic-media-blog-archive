					<description><![CDATA[This semester was a blast studying at Civic. I took Sasha Costanza-Chock&#8217;s Introduction to Civic Media where we studied a series of civic engagement aspects that include media (in a large sense). One of the objective of the course is to get students to work on a civic media project their are passionate about and present the results in the end of the semester. In my case, I decided to work with the CivicMaps Toolkit. [&#8230;]]]></description>

With a focus on grassroots, community groups and organizations, the CivicMaps Toolkit is currently being populated with case studies, open-source tools and platforms, interviews and other resources to assist those seeking to use maps to foster their social change goals. The idea is to create an online resource-central like MobileActive.org, but focused on the use of maps for social change. In that sense, [&#8230;]]]></description>

Probably the greatest thing about KoBo is that it has the limited internet connectivity in mind in all its products, adding offline syncing capabilities to all of them. In essence, you can collect, analyze, sync and map your data without having access to the internet.External Link: [&#8230;]]]></description>

Every year the conference gathers enthusiasts, professionals, geeks and wonks from everywhere to discuss humanitarian (information) technology to its best. New ideas were proposed, demos shown, a simulation took place, and a hackaton coded its way away. In a beautiful way, ICCM this year was an spectacular meeting overflowing with passion, creativity [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[  Civic Mapping or, in other words, mapping information for civic engagement, has taken quite an interesting turn in the last few years. Technology has become more accessible and data more available, but the essential difference is that there is a growing interest in using maps to display information. Maps can be great aids to decision-making as we all know very well. They have been used many times throughout the history of humanity, and probably [&#8230;]]]></description>

The digital society has brought humanity together more than any other invention in human kind. Providing equal access to all humans is among the most fundamental achievements necessary for a fairer planet. Regrettably, providing digital inclusion isn&#8217;t yet a priority for many.

My framework of analysis has been crafted to think of innovation, technology and development from the perspective of the policy-maker; from the side of big institutions or governments. In that framework the understood as ‘the public’ – the “civic” [&#8230;]]]></description>
