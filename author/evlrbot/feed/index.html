					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to the organizers of Journalism That Matters: Detroit and Time Life for awarding Red Ink a grant to attend the Reynolds Journalism Institute in August for the Innovate100 pitch slam. I&#8217;m going to use the opportunity to promote Red Ink, see what investors think of my crazy ideas, and try and improve Red Ink&#8217;s messaging to general audiences. Communicating the potential of Red Ink to serve communities has always been a big challenge. Because, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the last few weeks and months I&#8217;ve been putting a lot of thought into what Red Ink will function like in the real world. This means dealing with the fundamental issue of what business model makes sense for supporting a data sharing platform of this nature. To that end I wrote up a business plan for MIT&#8217;s $100K Business Plan Competition. Qualifying entries receive legal and venture mentors from the Boston/Cambridge area to help [&#8230;]]]></description>

Lot&#8217;s of revisions from the comm forum talk. Enjoy! Here&#8217;s the video from my &#8220;crit day&#8221; talk.

					<description><![CDATA[I gave a presentation on my thesis today to the entire Media Lab (eek!) I think it went well. There was lots of good questions from my critics and readers (thank you!). I&#8217;ll try to summarize: 1) David Reed seemed to think that the financial data would be self-reported by the users. Not true!
