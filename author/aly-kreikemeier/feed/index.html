					<description><![CDATA[This past March, 3,500 students walked out of Boston Public Schools (BPS) in a well organized action to protest a proposed $50 million budget cut to BPS which would result in the closure of schools, layoff of teachers, and diminished services in extracurricular spaces, AP classes and support for special-needs students. Young organizers began to mobilize weeks prior, beginning when a group of students reached out to the youth-led Boston Area Youth Organizing Project. In [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite spending the last few years of my work in conversations around creative community engagement and participatory projects, the idea of “civic education” still conjured images of my high school government teacher, a white-haired man with a love of golf who teased me for being the lone liberal in a sea of farmers more than he taught me about government. It was a surprise then when my colleagues at the Harvard Ed. School (HGSE) pushed [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Those who do not have the power over the story that dominates their lives, the power to retell it, rethink it, deconstruct it, joke about it, and change it as times change, truly are powerless, because they cannot think new thoughts.&#8221; &#8211; Salman Rushdie Story is powerful.

					<description><![CDATA[This week in Civic Media we discussed readings about digital inequality and blogospheres in Cuba and had the privilege of hearing from Paloma Duong who looks at digital media, youth culture, and the public sphere in contemporary Havana. We began by unpacking Eszter Hargittai’s The Digital Reproduction of Inequality through a group mapping exercise where we visualized the concepts put forth on a long whiteboard. An introductory premise of the article is to challenge a [&#8230;]]]></description>
