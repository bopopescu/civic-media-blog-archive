					<description><![CDATA[It’s the end of another semester at MIT, and the close of my time in CMS.360, Introduction to Civic Media. To close off the semester, I’ve posted a copy of the slides to my 5 minute Ignite talk from our last class about methods of connecting with voters in the 2012 presidential election campaigns. The 2012 campaigns are interesting because both parties utilized new technology to achieve traditional campaign goals — to connect with voters, [&#8230;]]]></description>

Part of the story&#8217;s intrigue was the campaign&#8217;s ability to collect massive amounts of data on voters and volunteers and use that data to target their messages. This week&#8217;s blog post will focus on ProPublica&#8217;s Message [&#8230;]]]></description>

For my final project, I will focus on mass communication from organizations with the intention of driving civic action, particularly methods and frequency of communication. With the 2012 elections, many found themselves the target of mass communication. This blog post will focus on one example of mass communication from a political campaign [&#8230;]]]></description>

Introduction The class first began with Luis Capelo talking about ICCM and Becky talking about the Center for Civic Media and Data Center’s Civic Maps Toolkit. Luis told us about the International Crisis Mappers Conference in Washington DC, which probably one of the most popular conferences [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve narrowed down the focus of my semester-long project. In my first post, I talked about looking at different commenting systems and the role they play in spreading information. I’ve decided to narrow down my focus to link spamming — links to sites that incite civic action placed in comments of content that isn’t intended to incite civic action. One of the most substantial examples of this was the 2008 U.S. beef protests in South [&#8230;]]]></description>

And for the second time doing this type of activity in this class, I was in the group that came up with a reference to nature — this time, we modeled change with&#8230; the water cycle. And since water cycles remind me of one of my favorite childhood books — The Magic [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With the growth of social media and various forms of participatory media, the line between the traditional content generators and the content consumers is fading. As a result, conversations and comments from consumers as well as their posts on social media are starting to become considered content itself. As media moves towards utilizing conversations and comments to provide more content and context, it’s important to think about the definition of having a “good” conversation, the [&#8230;]]]></description>

My group came up with a cute representation of digital inequality using a tree, where its roots represent components that add to digital equality, the leaves represent the fruit of digital equality, and falling fruit represents the idea that digital equality can fuel itself, just like a real ecosystem.

I was sitting in Starbucks right off MIT’s campus, hearing about his projects and talking about potential projects I could work on for a senior project that I’d have to complete in the spring.
