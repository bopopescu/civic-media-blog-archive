					<description><![CDATA[I finally installed the PageOneX real size project with stories related to guns, wars and terrorism. Come visit the display this week to the second floor of building E14 at MIT Media Lab. Thanks all of you that helped in this process! What follows is a photographic guide to the PageOneX real size installation.You’ll not find Washington Post or LA Times in Boston news stands. It’s so difficult to get the paper!

					<description><![CDATA[It was one of those ideas that seemed easy: to build a real size 1:1 scale of a PageOneX analysis. I just needed to buy 4 newspapers during 4 weeks, highlight certain stories, and put them on the wall. However, as it usually happens, things are easier said that done. Finding the newspapers I thought that buying the newspapers everyday would be the easy part, a question of self-discipline, but things are not what they seem. My first [&#8230;]]]></description>

It is also true that the levels of indignation have reached an apex, that they cause either incredulity or insensitivity. I decided to test PageOneX, a tool to visualize the evolution [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last Wednesday we had Pablo Gerbaudo presenting his book Tweets and the streets: Social Media and Contemporary Activism at the Center for Civic Media. It was a great opportunity to share ideas, and research, about the use of social networking sites in social mobilizations in the: Arab Spring (in Egypt), Indignados (Spain), Occupy (USA). break Though sound quality is not the best, you should be able to understand the talk,. It is the result of a [&#8230;]]]></description>

View this datavis full size at gigapan and the related post about May 2012 social  mobilizations in Spain. Today&#8217;s post is to present the tool we are building this summer: PageOneX. The idea behind is to make online and easier the coding process of front page newspapers. Make  this visualization process available for researchers, advocacy groups and anyone interested. I&#8217;ll will give some background about this process. How [&#8230;]]]></description>

This project began last May, during the first moments of the #SpanishRevolution. Since then, I&#8217;ve been making some experiments and improvements. Now that the term is coming to an end, I will go through the story of this process and try to envision future steps.
