					<description><![CDATA[I had the opportunity recently to speak with Jesse Shapins of MetaLAB at Harvard, co-founder of Zeega, a new platform for creating interactive documentaries and inventing new forms of storytelling. As the Zeega team have just been named a Knight News Challenge winner, I thought it would be nice to get a better sense of their innovative platform and what they&#8217;re planning for the fall. break Here&#8217;s a summary of the project, from Zeega&#8217;s website: [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Through the Center&#8217;s Department of Play and the Comparative Media Studies department, I&#8217;ve been working with a team of people to launch Aago, a mobile app for Apple devices focusing on media creation, organization and sharing. Targeted to teens, the app aims to help them document group or individual creative projects (filmmaking, tech or art projects, citizen journalism) by creating &#8220;stories&#8221; made up of mobile photos, videos, and audio clips, which can then be arranged [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently presented a paper at the International Conference on Technology, Knowledge and Society in Berlin, Germany. Elected as a graduate scholar to moderate the stream on &#8216;Technology in Community&#8217;, I had the privilege of meeting academics from around the world (some favorites included Christine Hine, Victoria Armstrong, Kathryn S. Coleman, and Jocelynne Scutt) working on research projects surrounding the use and impact of technologies on a local and global level. One of the presenters [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Forthcoming in the Fall issue of In Media Res, the newsletter of MIT&#8217;s Comparative Media Studies program. We arrived in Cajamarca in northern Peru just in time for an information and communications technology (ICT) training session for local internet entrepreneurs from rural villages across the country. The training site was picturesque – a large house surrounded by cows, streams, mountains, dirt. The minister of technology was in attendance, as was the project manager from FITEL [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Recently, I have been working in partnership with the founders of Digital Democracy to plan an upcoming media literacy project with recently arrived Burmese refugee youth and their American classmates in two high schools in Indiana. The folks at Digital Democracy are also taking part in a talk next week which I thought I would repost here, since the discussion will be streamed live online: In Burma/Myanmar, the military junta has ruled since 1962, brutally [&#8230;]]]></description>

Enterprising hackers are creating apps for sharing music and videos, to help you quit smoking and lose weight &#8212; spontaneously extending the text-based [&#8230;]]]></description>

Top prize is $15,000. It seems like an cool civic engagement contest for techies&#8230;the company says it&#8217;s all a part of their effort to encourage open source civic coders to help make government more transparent.

Check out some of his screenshot examples online: FutureMelbourne (a wiki for citizens to design a better Melbourne), Powerhouse Museum (a Sydney museum that allows users improve its online collections through tagging, ranking and sharing information), and Bang the Table (a service facilitating public policy discussion).

					<description><![CDATA[The U.S. Campaign for Burma has blown up over the past three years. They went from a few hundred members in 2005 to over 60,000 in 2008 &#8212; but without much of an increase in staff or funds. I wanted to examine how the use of digital media has helped increase their presence as an advocacy organization and enhanced their capacity to reach new grassroots activists. I talked to three key people at USCB and [&#8230;]]]></description>
