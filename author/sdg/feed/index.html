					<description><![CDATA[In my &#8220;hello world&#8221; post for this blog, I tried to define Civic Media as …a set of tools, technologies and practices that enable wider and more active participation in a democratic process. While writing this post, I remember trying to unpack the concept of &#8220;democratic process&#8221;, but I wasn&#8217;t sure about how to go about it. I talked about the &#8220;curation and synthesis of public knowledge&#8221; and the importance of expression, but it felt [&#8230;]]]></description>

On the 7th of June, Anonymous announced &#8220;Operation India&#8221; on Twitter, kicked off by the defacement the website of the Indian federal government&#8217;s nodal IT agency, the NIC, and the release of a list of [&#8230;]]]></description>

We frame our interview questions using our project’s three research questions (listed below). To make our conversations concrete, we plan to ask moderators to identify two-to-three examples of particularly challenging [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[BBC is one of the few mass media outlets that has a worldwide footprint, and as someone who used to live in a region which is heavily covered by the BBC, it was very interesting to see the &#8220;outside perspective&#8221; that it brought in for issues which had a strongly localized context. With the BBC going into the practice of inviting participation (via social networks) to their reporting process, I think it would be very [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While growing up in Calcutta, every day, while going to school, I would see a group of people having an animated conversation near the bus stop. They would be gathered around a long board made of weaved bamboo strips, on which the day&#8217;s newspaper would be pasted &#8211; all the pages one after the other, in a horizontal line. Some would be simply silently reading the various articles, but more often than not, there will [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For me, it was difficult to read both the Garnham and Chakravartty pieces (which is not surprising, since I come from a purely engineering background, and this is definitely out of my comfort zone). However, while going through the readings, I was constantly reminded of the debate in India about the issue of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indian companies, especially in the news media. After independence in 1947, the Indian government had prohibited any [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The 2007 report Packet Forgery By ISPs: A Report on the Comcast Affair by the Electronic Frontier Foundation talks about the practices of Comcast (the second largest Internet Service Provider in the United States) to control and differentially prioritize the flow of information through their network. This &#8220;interference&#8221;, as the EFF calls it, consisted mostly of Comcast crafting specialized TCP/IP network packets to disrupt the connections of users using peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols such as BitTorrent [&#8230;]]]></description>

The discussion topic for today&#8217;s edition of the class Introduction to Civic Media (CMS 360/860) was the digital divide.

In the past I have been involved in a number of Free and Open Source projects, and currently I’m involved in a Media Lab project called Scratch where kids can create and remix interactive media (games, animations, stories, etc) through programming, and share them online. In some ways, I have been an “in the trenches” [&#8230;]]]></description>
