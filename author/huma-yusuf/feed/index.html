					<description><![CDATA[Ed. note: Our research affiliate Huma Yusuf is in Karachi covering the political protests in Pakistan, and she is blogging about Pakistanis&#8217; uses of citizen journalism on The Dawn Blog, from which we&#8217;ll quote as Huma posts more. Pakistan, a developing nation with 17 million internet users in a population of over 150 million people, seems like an unlikely place for internet activism to thrive. But ongoing political turmoil (and a propensity for arbitrary arrests) [&#8230;]]]></description>

Abstract Arguments about digital technology, civic engagement, and collective action are often framed in the context of political participation in developed nations, particularly, the United States. Many have concluded that the availability of digital technologies and new media platforms facilitates democratic practices and participatory behavior. Whether this is equally true of the developing world remains to be critically examined. Pakistan is a developing nation where [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nilaja Sun’s one-woman play “No Child,” currently being staged at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, is a phenomenal mix of storytelling, journalism, activism, and civic engagement. The 70-minute performance isn’t bogged down by intricate sets, costume changes, or dazzling lighting design. Instead, Sun uses three chairs, a broom, and her ability to embody and humorously animate a dozen characters to start a meaningful conversation about education reform. The fact that it is as tech-free [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Much can be said about Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf’s decision to declare a state of emergency in my home country. In this post, I will set aside political commentary and restrict my comments here to the role that news media and new media are playing in the national crisis. On Saturday, November 3, soon after proclaiming emergency rule in a televised address, Musharraf demanded that all cable operators stop beaming the broadcasts of all local [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here at the Center for Future Civic Media, we try to be careful not to be technological determinists when brainstorming ideas for new technologies that can foster civic engagement. Most students remain wary of thinking that a well-designed device will promote participation, no matter what. Instead, our discussions emphasize the need to keep the social mores and everyday practices of a community in mind, so that the tools we design are culturally sensitive, and thus [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the past few weeks, students involved with C4FCM have been hopping between meetings, brainstorming ideas for new technologies and applications for existing technologies that can promote civic engagement and community building. A laundry list of desirable traits for new technologies with civic potential is emerging. New technologies deployed within a community should be inexpensive, scalable, and easily accessible on the part of the end user. A technology should not require the implementation of an [&#8230;]]]></description>
