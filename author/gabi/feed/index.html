					<description><![CDATA[Michael Kupperman, author of Mark Twain&#8217;s Autobiography 1910-2010, is a writer of what Ethan likes to call &#8220;civic fiction.&#8221; For more portrayls of civic fiction, Ethan is a fan of Benjamen Walker, who hosts Too Much Information on WFMU. It&#8217;s one of the more unusual shows you will ever listen to on the Internet. It&#8217;s hard to figure out, according to Ethan, if it&#8217;s an interview, a serious news piece, or storytelling that blurs the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[knightfoundation on livestream.com. Broadcast Live Free Note: This was written with the significant help of Amy Johnson Introduction Ethan introduced the panel (the final one between us and cocktails!) by offering that they have saved the best for last: stories and fables. It has been pointed out that it&#8217;s a bit of an edge topic, so the goal was to get people to think about the question of what happens when we engage in storytelling [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This past May I presented a thesis abstract proposal to the review board of the Dynamic Media Institute at MassArt that focused on how dynamic media may elevate the level of public discourse in our country. My feeling at the time was that the media’s penchant for polarized debates, combined with social media’s weak-tied, high-speed nature left us without the means for substantive, civil debate—political or otherwise. How serendipitous, then, the fact that a public [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[The following is the beginning of my introduction and a proposed, annotated outline for my project to date] On September 30th, I went down to Dewey Square to observe the first meeting of Occupy Boston in what would, at that time, become their new home. I spoke with a university professor, Leanne, and asked her why she was doing among the 100 or so other individuals in the square that evening. She spoke of starting [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[I wasn’t able to spend time on IRC this week, as by the time I gained access to the Etherpad to see the assignment, I was at my office. Ironically, almost half of the links from the articles were blocked; gaining access to IRC from my current client’s office is laughable at this point.] I’ve been thinking a great deal about the role of anonymity in discourse and consensus lately: anonymity as an enabler, anonymity [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I begin this class discussion review post with an admission: I really disliked being the scribe. Often trying to keep up, I found the collaborative electronic note taking to be quite distracting—a strong contrast to my preferred method of pencil and paper. Perhaps it was made slightly more difficult, however, by the fact that this particular class session was packed thickly with background, lecture, and perspective; Sasha&#8217;s experience as a participant in the Global Justice [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This week’s readings were particularly relevant to my project research, so it was exciting to read these having just returned from the [extremely chilly pre-snow] OccupyBoston site. I only got two interviews in before I had to head out (I’ll be returning for more soon), but I think I gained some important insight into the relationship between the “I” and the “We” at Occupy. Mostly, though, the interviews I conducted at Dewey Square got me [&#8230;]]]></description>

The bulk of the project will most likely include tracking down and scraping the data into a computer-readable format. From there, I would probably use Processing or OpenFrameworks to create an interactive visualization which would allow users to grasp the severe culture gap between white male and minority participation and ownership in mass [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Admittedly, I am getting a late start on this week’s blog post, primarily due to the fact that to understand Garnham’s “Political Economy of Mass Communication,” I needed some serious contextualization. My undergraduate business education provided very little background on political economy (at least, not from a purely Marxist standpoint), and certainly nothing on the idealists of the bourgeois cultural society. But the extra time allowed me to comment on what Garnham (or Uricchio, or [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In its 2008 report entitled “Fighting Poverty: Utilizing Community Media in a Digital Age,” the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters features a piece by Bruce Girard, a community based media expert. His essay, “Community Radio, New Technologies and Policy,” lays out a brief history of community radio in relation to its growth over time thanks to both technological and policy based advancements. He laments the fact, however, that at the time of publishing, community [&#8230;]]]></description>
