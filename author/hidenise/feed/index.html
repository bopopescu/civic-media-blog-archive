A proposal—Regulations for Smartphone Technology for Taxicabs and Limousines—served as grounding for the discussion around how to regulate private transportation and/or update the definition of private transportation. An alert went out [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last week, I was in San Francisco as a panelist and plenary speaker at the inaugural SHARE conference. The event was organized by Peers (a research partner in January) and SOCAP, and I spoke about the future of work. I also gave a lightning talk at the closing plenary. All of the plenary speakers had to bookend their lightning talk with &#8220;&#8212; catalyze the sharing economy.&#8221; I took advantage of this five-minute window to urge [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[During my last trip to San Francisco, I heard about Marc Roth’s unconventional but sensible use of assistance money when he was homeless: He bought a membership to an SF makerspace. Marc learned the ins and outs of digital fabrication, started a successful laser cutting business, and now he’s ready to pilot The Learning Shelter, a 90-day residency program for SF homeless to build marketable making skills. I’m enthralled. I’ve been exploring the future of [&#8230;]]]></description>

While I could go on about how economic security is the cornerstone for meaningful pursuits—including civic participation—here&#8217;s a direct media tie in. The following is an excerpt from my thesis draft.  The Fordist framework1 is fraying quickly. Economic decline, technological displacement and globalization have resulted in a shortage [&#8230;]]]></description>

Women coders, technologists in local government, architects in humanitarian aid, geographers in newsrooms.

In a recent blog post, he neatly sums up how peer economy proponents appear to advocate selectively for its place in the formal economy. When should the sharing economy be treated as part of the real economy, and when should it not? Are you confused? Here is a short guide for the perplexed.   When the sharing economy should be excluded from the formal economy: [&#8230;]]]></description>

The Mesh author Lisa Gansky* has said it&#8217;s about access, not ownership. Resulting questions ask whether certain generations are more amenable to sharing. Are urban areas predisposed to sharing? Is Europe an intrinsically more sharing culture than America? Can this ethic be rolled into environmental benchmarks?

Two Harvard profs just released a study that examined the correlation between pricing and race on Airbnb. Airbnb’s racist! Well that’s not actually how the professors said it, but that’s what many headlines have looked like.

I&#8217;m not continuing onto a Ph.D. after June, so before I leave my post as an academic who researches the peer economy, I&#8217;m going to report what I&#8217;m seeing and sensing as I see and sense it. 20-20!

That&#8217;s what my peer economy research expeditions feel like as I scour publications and interviews. I&#8217;ve stumbled upon the surprising history of property rights, technical definitions of firms and human capital, frameworks for worker cooperative networks, the push-pull between technological progress and socio-political arrangements, and more. In all of that, [&#8230;]]]></description>
