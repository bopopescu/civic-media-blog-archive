If you would like to read the entire paper, please leave a comment with your email address and I will personally send it to you. My final project, a 34-page monster titled Digital Discourse and Civic Engagement in Ukraine, examines how specific technological, structural, and discursive conditions of Internet use in Ukraine have affected democratic consolidation by promoting virtual public spheres that encourage political deliberation [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Originally, I defined civic media as “the tools and technologies that facilitate the exchange of information and ideas between people, often in pursuit of common goals.” I also noted that it’s important to avoid normative judgments of civic media, because the effects and potential of these tools are dependent upon the intentions of those who utilize them. After learning more about digital inequalities, however, I would also like to add that the impact of civic [&#8230;]]]></description>

Molly Sauter also dropped by to contribute. Lulz, while not necessarily as intellectualized, is a modern incarnation of satire as political critique. In times and spaces where open political dissidence is suppressed, jokes and satire are some of the few available outlets for expressing discontent. As a contemporary example, Sasha related a story from 2005 in [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Using Ukraine as my point of reference, I decided to list some of the pros and cons of online media in democratic transition and consolidation. My eventual aim is to gain an understanding of why the same tools that enabled Ukraine’s democratic transition have been so ineffective at the stage of consolidation. Mind you, I am trying to avoid falling into the trap of techno-determinism. Rather than scrutinize the inherent qualities of the technology itself, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently undertook the task of comparing leading independent online news sources for the Central, Eastern, Western, and Southern regions of Ukraine. My overall goal was to get a better sense of the political orientations of these websites, their readership and their content, as well as gauge the inclusivity of voices. At the same time, I was also looking for material related to ICTs in Ukraine. In the interest of time, I&#8217;ll briefly discuss some [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To better visualize ICT accessibility and usage in Ukraine, I&#8217;ve created a few very rough charts based on data from the World Economic Forum&#8217;s Global Information Technology Report from 2010-2011 (find it here: www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GITR_Report_2011.pdf), I&#8217;ve also highlighted results from the US, Russia, and Estonia for broader context. (I chose Estonia because it is an EU memberstate that is rather democratic and technologically developed despite its Soviet past). The shaded areas represent the other countries on [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Project Update: In writing my introduction, I had to ask myself some important questions: Why does my project matter? Why should we care about the impact of ICTs in Ukraine? I came across an interesting article by Michael McFaul suggesting that the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine may have been the first movement of its kind to be largely organized online. The websites of advocacy groups like Maidan and Pora, as well as the online [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In Ukraine, the unique processes of post-Soviet nation building, democratization and derussification have paralleled the proliferation of communications technology worldwide. The thriving Ukrainian blogosphere, in particular, has become fertile ground for engaging new forms of community and nationhood – but does it have the potential to become an alternative public sphere? My project will focus on the logistical issues in promoting digital access and literacy in Ukraine and how they affect the formation of cohesive [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was just over twenty years ago when Herman and Chomsky developed their propaganda model to analyze how information and communications systems are controlled in seemingly “free” political contexts – i.e. capitalist societies, in juxtaposition with the monopolistic Eastern Bloc. A true sign of the times, anticommunist ideology was even listed as a mechanism for manipulating media content in the West. Since then, the world has become far less polarized; however, many former Soviet nations [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Radical Media, according to Robert D.H. Downing, are “media, generally small-scale and in many different forms, that express an alternative vision to hegemonic policies, priorities and perspectives” (v, 2001). In chapter IV of his book, Radical Media: Rebellious Communication and Social Movements, Downing asks how radical media can strengthen democratic culture in everyday life, stating that traditional analytical frameworks too often ignore the question of communication and the “messy reality” of democratizing media (42).
