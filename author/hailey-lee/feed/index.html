					<description><![CDATA[The November 16th class readings focused on the history and expansion of &#8216;Anonymous,&#8217; originating with their traditional form of lighthearted dissent and satire for the sake of &#8216;lulz&#8217; to becoming a passionate political movement. Personally, I find that Anonymous cannot be both types at the same time&#8211;it not only detracts from the groups identity, it also obscures its purpose of existence and stretches its influence far too wide. The two forms of Anonymous are polar [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Critical political economy is a tool with which we can critically examine the media. It takes a distinctly Marxist approach to the study of communications. Focuses include analyzing how various economic classes are affected, how people have different levels of access to communications technologies, how capitalism affects the media and cultural industries, and how corporate ownership affects what the media produces. Key question for critical political economy approach is whether the economics of production shape [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The report on Latino Congreso 2011 reveals how a group of Latino community scholars are forging conversations regarding media justice (internet freedom) to address larger societal problems. These conversations have empowered and inspired Latinos to strategize on how to solve these inequalities. The report is here: http://centerformediajustice.org/2011/03/27/and-life-and-the-people-neve&#8230; The author observes a unique phenomenon in this group&#8217;s mobilization process: Indeed, the National Latino Congreso is just like any other people-centered grassroots movement&#8211;yet that&#8217;s what makes it [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What might this mean, why might it be (or not be) a useful concept? Provide 3-5 linked examples to illustrate your argument. The term &#8216;networked counterpublics&#8217; can be most accurately defined by focusing on the individual terminology of &#8216;networked&#8217; and &#8216;counter publics.&#8217; Counterpublics represent minority groups that are excluded from the mainstream public sphere. Their insular status and under-proliferation of their interests and stances are the reasons for the term &#8216;counter-publics.&#8217; These groups may form [&#8230;]]]></description>
