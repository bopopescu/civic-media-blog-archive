Joi Ito (@joi), Director of the MIT Media Lab, is here to share his nine principles. Nearly thirty years ago when the Media Lab was founded, the internet was about connecting together supercomputers.

					<description><![CDATA[Liveblog of Kate Darling&#8217;s Berkman Center lunch, A discussion of near-term ethical, legal, and societal issues in robotics. Kate begins with the observation that there aren&#8217;t nearly enough experts in robotic law. Those that are interested in the emergent field need to become more expert, and many more need to join them in the pursuit. Here are some of the emerging issues: Liability: the chain of causality of harm is going to get longer and [&#8230;]]]></description>

Clay&#8217;s first point is that of all the criticism of Healthcare.gov and the Affordable Care Act, no one has argued that it&#8217;s a bad idea to rely on the web as the central component of citizen interaction with a government program.

					<description><![CDATA[These are the moments that make the other moments of attempted unity more difficult, more hollow, for many among us. Before giving into the polarized reactions that the Trayvon Martin story has elicited from its onset, we might practice a little empathy for those for whom the case represented a great deal more than George Zimmerman&#8217;s fate. My thoughts race tonight to the family of Trayvon Martin, who fought so hard through personal emotions and [&#8230;]]]></description>

The catalyst for the conversation is a DoSomething.org petition with over 50,068 signatures (in just over a day) against Ken Hoinsky&#8216;s successfully completed Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. Hoinsky&#8217;s initial $2,000 goal was surpassed, reaching $16,639 before the campaign ended. (The reason people have taken issue with Hoinsky&#8217;s Above [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Photo by @brianquinn Robin Chase (@rmchase), founder of ZipCar and BuzzCar, started the first company WAY back in 2000. It made renting a car as convenient as owning car, and &#8220;right-sized the asset&#8221;, meaning you only pay for what you use. In addition to huge savings and new freedoms for consumers, this meant fewer cars sitting around unused in cities. But less obviously, Zipcar stretched the definitions of &#8220;consumers&#8221; and &#8220;producers&#8221; in an economy. Robin [&#8230;]]]></description>

These problems came up in multiple sessions at the National Conference on Media Reform last weekend. There are also obvious reasons to continue using these platforms (audience reach, most notably), and so we do. Some activist efforts that silo communications on more open, but relatively unknown platforms strike me as irresponsible, if the goal is to reach [&#8230;]]]></description>

The SOPA protest was the biggest online protest we&#8217;ve seen. Millions of people participated and made a real impact. For organizers who have been fighting on open internet issues, it was exciting to see so many people take action and recognize that the internet is something you have to proactively protect, or else the openess that you know and love and maybe didn&#8217;t think [&#8230;]]]></description>
