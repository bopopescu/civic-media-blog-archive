Our project is entitled “Television Newsroom Diversity and Civic Engagement.” Abstract In the United States, employment demographics for television news do not accurately reflect the nation’s ethnic makeup. According to the Radio and Television Digital News Association’s 2011 report on women and minorities in the news, “In the last 21years, the minority population in [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The week of 11/28, we discussed Failed Civic Media projects with Benjamin Mako Hill. We discussed why some projects fail, what could have prevented them from failing, why some projects succeed, and what we can learn from both failure and success. At the time of this lecture I didn’t think I had participated in any civic media projects that had failed. Then I took a look back to the dreaded years: high school. When I [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This week, we were asked to re-read our first blog post for Intro to Civic Media, and to reflect upon whether or not our views have changed. What remained the same? My definition was “Any medium that creates information flow to a community or communities in order to foster participatory spirit in decision making.” The last part of my definition &#8220;to foster participatory spirit in decision making&#8221; was meant not only to mean government decision [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The topic for Monday November 14th’s class was Hyperlocal civic media. This post is a summary of that discussion, which was facilitated by Ania. Raw notes can be found here: http://etherpad.brownbag.me/p/hyperlocalcivicmedia We read two pieces that focused on geoethicnic and hyperlocal media. We also discussed community websites in the Boston area. Here are the two readings we did for this session: • Kim, Y.-C., Ball-Rokeach, S. J. (2006).

Over the past week, Hailey and I have been developing questions for our video component. We have also been reaching out to various Boston news organizations for appearance requests.

Our Working Title: Minority Representation in the Boston Television News Industry One interesting fact that was pointed out to Hailey and I in class was that Boston is now a “minority” dominated city, so the terminology of our paper might get tricky. Once we collect more data, we will decide what terminology to [&#8230;]]]></description>

Radical media exists not necessarily as an opposition to mainstream media. Downing says that radical media fit into the realm of popular culture.

					<description><![CDATA[I think a “networked counterpublic” is a networked space where marginalized or minority members of a society can create discourse. I think the concept of networked counterpublics is a useful concept and important to understand. By putting information on the web marginalized or minority groups or individuals can make their views and discourses available to countless people. I think the primary purpose of these networked spaces is discourse, but the counterpublic does create the opportunity [&#8230;]]]></description>
