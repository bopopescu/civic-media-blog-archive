					<description><![CDATA[The Junkyard Jumboron is a really quick, web-based way to combine many people&#8217;s laptops (9, 12, 20&#8230;) into a giant, eye-catching display. It&#8217;s useful for&#8230; &#8230;when you&#8217;re organizing a rally, and you wan to draw the interest of passers-by. &#8230;when you&#8217;ve assembled a cool collection of people, and you want to capture a unique photograph of the event. &#8230;when your organization has a storefront, and you want to call attention to your cause.

					<description><![CDATA[Rick Borovoy, Visiting Scientist at the MIT Media Lab and the Center for Future Civic Media, proudly unveils the first Lost in Boston sign. LostInBoston.org is a general-purpose web tool that cities can use to get citizens involved in civic improvement projects. It&#8217;s about helping Bostonians work together to make their neighborhoods more visitor-friendly. Community groups are partnering with local businesses and institutions to design signs that call out the key spots in their area. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[If the video is not embedded above, go here] Everyone knows that creating a startup involves a carefully-ordered sequence of steps &#8212; eg, don&#8217;t start selling your product until you have a product (actually, that&#8217;s surprisingly easy to screw up). However, there&#8217;s a guiding principle about designing the right sequence that doesn&#8217;t get talked about enough. You need to think about designing your &#8220;Validation Trajectory&#8221;. Here&#8217;s the deal: In the Pony Diving phase (see Episode [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to Episode #2 of Rick&#8217;s Startup Whiteboard (the video is at http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/4106-ricks-startup-whiteboard-episode-2-ear&#8230; if it&#8217;s not showing up above). This one focuses on the importance of working with partners &#8212; not employees, not contractors &#8212; when you&#8217;re the pony-diving stage of a startup project, still trying to figure out the key pieces of the puzzle (see episode #1 on pony diving). Personally, I learned this one the hard way in a start-up. We contracted out [&#8230;]]]></description>

The first clip is about &#8220;Pony Diving&#8221; &#8212; the very early stages where you&#8217;re trying to put together an idea with a technology that can implement it with a group of people who will use it, another group [&#8230;]]]></description>
