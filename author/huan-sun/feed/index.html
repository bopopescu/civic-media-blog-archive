About 30 Chinese software developers and 10 NGOs participated in this two-day event. At the end, four teams came up with three web applications and one mobile app. A collection of pictures taken during the event can be found at our Netease album.

					<description><![CDATA[This semester for a class on HCI, I have been looking at dual screen experience that people interact with mobile devices while watching TV in China. I collected over 1 million Sina Weibo messages during &#8216;Chunwan&#8217; (春晚), a state sponsored TV program to celebrate Chinese New Year, which is also a popular cultural event that almost everyone in China participates. While the social engagement aspect of this study is still ongoing, for now one of [&#8230;]]]></description>

What are the biggest barriers for them to fully take advantage of new technologies? Are information communication technology(ICT) infrastructures still the barriers for grassroots NGOs? What type of assistance they might need to develop integrated practices of the internet to advance their causes? Aiming at answering these questions, NGO2.0 is launching our third ICT capacity survey! (Scene of 2012 Chengdu Web2.0 Training Workshop, China) The [&#8230;]]]></description>

According to a recent news report, Weibo has over 300 million users, and 100 million posts are generated everyday. In contrast with its counterpart in the West, a large number of studies on Twitter has been done, but the number of studies on Weibo is rather limited. Some researchers are constrained in studying Weibo because of language issues. For those who are sufficient in [&#8230;]]]></description>

This strategy aims to generate pressure from the public to the authority, and thus increase the possibility of success of the movements. However, scholars of Chinese studies find the strategy of resistance in authoritarian countries is not explicitly adversarial. Activists often position themselves in line with the official ideology so [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This week I am working on a model to map out civic actions in China. I borrowed models on social movements in the field of political science and added one dimension, the level of centralization of the media involved in the civic actions, to understand various types of civic actions in China. I do not intend to include all forms of participations but to provide an analytical method when categorizing them. 1. Hierarchy of Media [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[During the past two months, I examined the use of the term &#8220;media ecology&#8221; by different scholars and reviewed some works on Chinese Internet. One school of study on the media ecology defines it in broader way, and focuses on its fundamental influence on the society as a whole, the impact on the culture and its potential to alter people&#8217;s way of thinking. I also wrote about how Chinese scholars approach the topic of media and civil [&#8230;]]]></description>

Providing snapshots of the information flow in 2011 Tunisian and Egyptian Revolutions, they point out that the nature of news work is experiencing the shift from the era of mass media to the networked digital media.

					<description><![CDATA[The question how Internet empowers or disempwers Chinese civil society has haunted me for some time and in 2010 I did a Chinese college students survey to try to establish the linear causal relationship between social networking sites use and their political participation, but when I look back I feel the question being asked might be too simplistic.
