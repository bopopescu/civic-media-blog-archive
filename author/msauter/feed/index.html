					<description><![CDATA[x-posted from oddletters.com Sometime between the power outage Thursday night that left most of Cambridge in the dark and severely messed with my ability to construct my Ignite slide deck, and getting up at 5AM to catch a taxi to the airport, I started to have serious doubts about whether I should go to NewsFoo at all. Reading over the guest list (NewsFoo is a by-invitation conference) was an exercise in “Oh God, everyone is [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A FOIA, or Freedom of Information Act, request is supposed to be a way for the average citizen to reveal information and documents controlled by the federal government. Anyone can file a FOIA request for pretty much damn near everything, and in Intro to Civic Media we started that process a few weeks ago. Even though most federal agencies are required to respond to FOIA requests, those responses can range from helpful to not helpful [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My work on my final project for Intro to Civic Media, an examination of the ethics of activist distributed denial of service attacks, continues apace. I&#8217;ve got a good pile of primary sources from groups that have historically engaged in activist DDOS actions, including the Electronic Disturbance Theater and the electrohippies, as well as my ever growing stash of Anonymous-related materials. I&#8217;m also looking more deeply into some recent DDOS actions in Russia, as well [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I may be a little tired of the election news cycle. In class this week we made up NewsJacks of the CNN and Fox News front pages from Wednesday night. Despite the fact that the Northeast was still being wracked by the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, CNN felt it was necessary to *still* make one of its &#8220;above the fold&#8221; headlines about the election: namely &#8220;Can storms ruin election campaigns?&#8221; God, I can only hope [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In Sasha&#8217;s class last week we tried to calculate our value to the online social networks we participate in. In the equation my partner and I created, we took into account three variables: Biodata, Influence, and System Value. Our equation is: (Biodata + System Value) to the power of Influence = Value of the User We defined Biodata as anything that is contained within the social network&#8217;s conception of the user as an individual, so [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the last year and a half or so, I&#8217;ve been studying the use of distributed denial of service attacks in activism. This is part of a larger analysis of the practice of civil disobedience in an online context, an exploration which has taken me into hacktivism in the 1990s and early 2000s, doxxing and human flesh search on the Chinese internet, and Anonymous in the present day. Last year I wrote a paper on [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello all again! This is Molly Sauter. I&#8217;m a second year graduate student in Comparative Media Studies and at RA here at the Center for Civic Media. I took the Networked Social Movements class last semester, and this semester I&#8217;m looking forward to spending more time poking at the function of technology in social movements and protest. This particular interest of mine made our first class meeting very interesting. In an effort to come up [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I published a new essay over at HiLobrow on the evolution and symbolism of the Guy Fawkes mask in Anonymous and protest culture. If you&#8217;re interested in how symbols work within protest movements, or Anonymous culture, please do check it out! &#8220;Anonymous is one face of a broad anti-authoritarian, pro-freedom sentiment; its iconic mask symbolizes both that movement’s ends, its means (individuals collected as a single entity), and the right to anonymous public political participation.

					<description><![CDATA[This week in Co-Design I&#8217;m looking at the field of Participatory Design. Participatory Design has a much more establish history than most of the other sub-genres of co-design I&#8217;ve been looking at. It had its start in Scandinavia in the 1970&#8217;s, emerging from trade union movements. It shares an ideological lineage with Sociotechnical Design and Action research. Initially, the goal of Participatory Design was to shift the stance of technology from one which inherently favored [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In today&#8217;s episode of the Co-Design Lit Review, I&#8217;m looking at the Collaborative Design space. I noticed something interesting while working on this week&#8217;s chapter. The term &#8220;collaborative design&#8221; is most predominantly used to refer to the use of multi-disciplinary design teams and not explicitly to community involvement in the design process. Because of this, there is a lot of interesting work in the collaborative design space on topics like conflict resolution and work flow. [&#8230;]]]></description>
