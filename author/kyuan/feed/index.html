You can find the full text at the bottom of this post. My project focuses on evaluating crisis mapping used during 2010 Haitian earthquake. It began as Maps for Mankind, a Youtube channel that would feature interesting mapping tools. My original plan was to focus my final project on civic mapping, but I realized it was way too broad of a [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last Wednesday, we all made a 30 second blurb about our what our final projects will be. I made a video that combines all of our ideas, with some relaxing Jazz music. Enjoy! Since Youtube frustratingly removed the option to use the old embed code, I also have a link you can copy and paste. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyEQAM4_9aU Last Wednesday, we all made a 30 second blurb about our what our final projects will be.

					<description><![CDATA[As we get closer to the final project, I will narrow down the subject matter of my videos. One of my favorite episodes was the one about Google crisis maps. I really enjoyed the class discussion we had about civic maps, and writing up the case study for the Civic maps toolkit was also enjoyable. I believe that crowd sourcing to create civic maps is not only really cool, but also carries the potential to [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Watch the new video. All the information about this unique mapping tool is included: As far as the overall project, it&#8217;s been going pretty well so far. Collecting useful mapping tools has not been very difficult, as I would discover them by browsing the internet or checkout out Facebook posts. There is so much information to be found on the web, but the problem is that people are much more willing to be on Reddit [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last week, our group attempted to create an equation detailing the net worth of a single Facebook account. We imagined a situation in which Mark Zuckerberg decided to dis-invest all of Facebook&#8217;s net worth to each user, based on the net worth of their respective profiles. The question and scenario are both fairly straightforward, but the solution is not so much. There are many factors and variables to take into account, especially a social networking [&#8230;]]]></description>

Instead of having a single theory, however, our group divulged into two camps on what an idealized model would be like. Today, I would like to discuss the model that I had personally worked on more, and that would be the colored &#8220;human pyramid&#8221; in the picture below. We wanted to draw a model and demonstrated the current state of society, which can [&#8230;]]]></description>

Although I feel that my project proposals are much more elementary than the others, I still have some positive feedback from a few of my ideas. I&#8217;ve essentially narrowed it down to two ideas: the humorous educational sketches and analyzing data visualization of various networks. I really like the first idea of creating humorous, yet informative shows on Youtube, mostly because [&#8230;]]]></description>

Even though everyone else in the class seems much more well informed than me, I feel that&#8217;s a great thing. I have no reason to attend college and take this course if I already knew about Civic Media. During my first class, we developed a model for digital inclusion (which we called the Pie). Admittedly, it is still a work of progress. We [&#8230;]]]></description>
