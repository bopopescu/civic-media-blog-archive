					<description><![CDATA[I attended the Mobile Tech 4 Social Change barcamp in New York with MIT colleagues Audubon Dougherty, Nadav Aharony, and Danielle Martin last weekend. Unfortunately, I missed Ethan Zuckerman’s keynote (hoping it will be posted online) but according to Patrick Meier’s informative post about the day, one of Ethan’s biggest takeaway points focused on the importance of using of multiple technologies together: (The) convergence of ICTs is far more powerful than the increasingly ubiquitous mobile [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many Eyes, a shared data and information visualization technology from the Visual Communications Lab at IBM Research, offers some fun ways to see the most commonly used words in President Obama&#8217;s inaugural address. You can look at the speech as a text cloud &#8230; .. or a word tree. Perhaps because Obama has been compared to John F. Kennedy quite often, someone has recently posted Kennedy&#8217;s 1961 inaugural address on the site. Many Eyes allows [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wondering what innovative media projects are following President-elect Obama’s inauguration? We have a few suggestions. One of the most exciting is Inauguration Report, a collaboration between NPR, CBS News, American University, and volunteer programmers. Users can participate via Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, an iPhone app by including the phrase #inaug09 0r #dctrips09 (pound signs are not required for flicker and youtube content). The site is also mapping the location of reports nationwide. As of late Thursday, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In my work at the Center for Future Civic Media, I’ve been investigating ways that emerging technologies could be used to better the quality of healthcare in local communities. I’ve been particularly interested in exploring ways to improve the communication between doctors and their patients. I recently spoke with Jay Parkinson [no relation to the disease of the same name], a licensed medical doctor, who offers a creative approach to addressing some of these pressing [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last weekend, thousands of people around the country took part in rallies aimed to convince Congress to cut carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050. Created with the guidance of a new online organization called Step It Up, these do-it-yourself campaigns reflect a trend in activism–one in which the rallies are distributed through communities and nationally coordinated only in the sense that they occur around an issue, or are timed to happen on a certain [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are, of course, numerous innovative initiatives emerging worldwide that make use of mobile technologies. To date, mobile devices have already been used to encourage learning, monitor elections, organize protests, play games, share images, and share vital health information. But sometimes the issue is figuring out how to identify what’s right for a specific community. The sheer magnitude of information, not to mention the constant stream of new technologies (that often require new literacies) make [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A few days ago, I had the opportunity to listen to Ethan Zuckerman speak during MIT’s Communications Forum, “What is Civic Media?” After the event, I spoke to Ethan Zuckerman about Global Voices Online, an organization that he co-founded with journalist Rebecca McKinnon through Harvard Law School’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Global Voices Online (GVO) describes itself as “a non-profit global citizens’ media project” that “seeks to aggregate, curate, and amplify the global [&#8230;]]]></description>
