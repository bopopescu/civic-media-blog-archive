					<description><![CDATA[Qualcomm Spark has offered the following response to my previous blog post, Hackathons don&#8217;t solve problems. My name is Michelle Kessler, and I’m the editor-in-chief of Qualcomm Spark. First, we want to thank Charlie DeTar, J. Nathan Matias and the MIT Media Lab for participating in our most recent video, “Hackathons: Tech’s Answer to Big Problems.” Also, thanks to Charlie for giving us the opportunity to respond to his comments and ideas.

					<description><![CDATA[Qualcomm, a company known for their manufacture of semiconductors, stopped by the Center for Civic Media a few weeks ago to interview people about hackathons. Today, they released the video, which features Nathan Matias and I: Thankfully, all of the words that I say on the screen in the video are words that I actually said. But the edit and framing message that they present is literally the opposite of what I said in the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve been working on online tools for consensus for the last 2 years. Here&#8217;s what motivates me to work on this. 1. The water heater For my first five years in Boston, I lived in a housing co-op in Dorchester.  It&#8217;s a classic Boston triple-decker, which the 13 residents own collectively. That means that we didn&#8217;t have a landlord, but we were in charge of the mortgage, maintenance, utilities, and everything else. The house operated [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In an insightful essay at the New Republic, Evgeny Morozov raises a powerful critique of what he describes as &#8220;Internet-centrism&#8221; in Steven Johnson&#8217;s 2012 book Future Perfect. Morozov identifies in Johnson&#8217;s book a strain of popular rhetoric which holds that the Internet is a model of decentralization, horizontalism, and leaderlessness, and that the world would be improved by applying these features to other domains. While most of the essay is spot-on, I&#8217;d like to complicate [&#8230;]]]></description>

I had come to the meeting with a petition of around 1000 signatures that I had gathered at my high school supporting wilderness, [&#8230;]]]></description>

Live streaming offers a compelling way to experience a protest on-the-ground as it&#8217;s happening – and it has even trickled up to more traditional media services.

					<description><![CDATA[Something that has been echoed by many of the speakers at today&#8217;s Knight Civic Media Conference is the importance of considering who participates in the design of a technology. Sasha Constanza-Chock spoke about the importance of using open technologies and open data when developing tools for communities. Chris Csikszentmihalyi spoke about how those with power producing technology tend to make technologies that reinforce their power.

We have a selection of new posts from new authors, as well as old posts from long time authors.

					<description><![CDATA[Today, Google Maps is rolling out bicycle directions:http://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/03/google-maps-for-bikes There are a number of existing bike map providers, many of which have grown through community-provided, crowd-sourced data. One could argue that these projects have struggled to garner sufficient participation to really take off: http://www.bikely.com/ http://www.nycbikemaps.com/maps/nyc-bike-map/ http://opentripplanner.org/ http://www.opencyclemap.org/ Now, all at once, Google is offering bike maps in 150 cities with relatively comprehensive routes.
