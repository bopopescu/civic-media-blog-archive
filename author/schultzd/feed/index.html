					<description><![CDATA[Let me start by saying this blog post is short and boring. This is intentional because I don&#8217;t want it shared at all, I just want to give a quick progress update and explain how to use Page One Remix in its current state. That state will continue to improve before I consider the project ready to fully rock, which is why I don&#8217;t want it shared with the world yet (don&#8217;t get me wrong, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As we all know the most important part of any successful project is completely changing your idea at the last minute. In that spirit I am about to present a progress update on a project that has nothing to do with the revamped IRC interface I outlined last time (note that the IRC project isn’t dead, but I’ll be working on it over IAP instead). Here’s my new plan: I am going to make it [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love IRC and you should too. IRC (Internet Relay Chat) was the new hotness over 9000 years ago and it is still just as spectacular today! Like I always say, however, if it isn&#8217;t broke, break it. That&#8217;s right, I want to change the way people interface with this group chat behemoth for my final project. Before I get into what I mean you need to know a bit about what IRC actually is. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Before I get into my post let me describe my experience with these readings so far as a quick stream of consciousness: Civic media? Easy peasy I know that stuff. Woah, There’s a lot of insight in these papers. I knew nothing before. Now my power level is going to be over 9000! Wait, what the face is an interlocutor? WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BRACKET STATUS DIFFERENTIALS? Maybe I get it now&#8230; thanks Google! [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Five years ago I was a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University trying to decide between 11 different fields of study. Meanwhile, the Journalism industry was beginning a transformation of its own as Internet-based panic and disruption was reaching a critical mass among Newspapers and professional informers. That was the year that Knight began their News Challenge, the program that funded the creation of this center. In what must have been a fluke I became one [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cross-posted with PBS IdeaLab. I attended last Thursday&#8217;s afternoon plenary &#8220;Civic Media Mobilization,&#8221; at the 2011 Knight Civic Media conference, expecting to hear discussion about specific activist technologies and techniques. I was also anticipating some juicy political friction between the Tea Party consultant and the immigrant law community organizer who were speaking at the event. Neither prediction came to pass. Instead I witnessed a far more situation-based analysis of what incentivizes action that concluded with [&#8230;]]]></description>
