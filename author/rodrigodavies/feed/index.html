					<description><![CDATA[Earlier this week I gave a talk at Stanford&#8217;s Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society, publishers of the Stanford Social Innovation Review, on civic crowdfunding. I was excited to share how my research into crowd-based community finance has evolved, and how Neighborly&#8216;s launch this summer will make impact investing a local reality for the first time in the US. Here&#8217;s the talk. Here&#8217;s the transcript of the video above. Hey I’m Rodrigo. I’m an on leave PhD candidate [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the past couple of years I&#8217;ve been thinking about how to bring the energy, potential and ambition of donation/reward crowdfunding to community development and civic engagement. I was lucky to be an early employee of Spacehive, one of the first movers in the space, I put together the first study of the field (with the help of Ethan and others at MIT), and I got to watch as the idea of civic crowdfunding caught [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last month at the Media Lab, Helena, Jen, Michaela and I organized Build Peace, a conference to bring together practitioners from the worlds of peacebuilding and technology to talk about how the two fields could work together. It was an incredibly enlightening and generative three days, and before the first conference had even finished, we had already decided that there needed to be a Build Peace 2015. If you missed it, you can catch up [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today I&#8217;m capping two years of studying the emergence of civic crowdfunding by submitting my oligarch&#8217;s thesis to the MIT archives. Great thanks are due to the wonderful collaborators I&#8217;ve had the privilege of working with. I won&#8217;t name everyone here, but all of you folks will find your names in the Acknowledgments section. You can read Civic Crowdfunding: Participatory Communities, Entrepreneurs and the Political Economy of Place in its entirety (173 pages) now, and if you do so, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There’s a tradition in Peru called the pollada – literally, a chicken party. These parties perform a very important social function. Say I’m about to have a child and I’m worried about how I’m going to pay education or healthcare bills. I hold a pollada to raise money by inviting friends and family around for chicken and beers, and selling tickets to the event. The tickets are usually priced fairly highly. The friends who come to my [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Civic crowdfunding is the beginning of a new type of participatory democracy for communities.&#8221;&#8220;Civic crowdfunding is a triumph of individualism over the collective good.&#8221;&#8220;Civic crowdfunding is the result of a crisis in government.&#8221; These three divergent intepretations are among the most common responses to civic crowdfunding. I hear them in one form or another almost every time I give a talk on the topic. Despite their differences, these interpretations are also, for the moment, coexisting [&#8230;]]]></description>

Next month in Lima, Peru, I&#8217;ll be co-hosting a three-day workshop for entrepreneurs in the creative industries, focused on design thinking, product development and fundraising. It&#8217;s an exciting project called Creative Industries Prototyping Lab, and applications to attend the workshop are open now. We&#8217;re looking for entrepreneurs who already have the germ of a product or service idea, but are looking to refine their thinking and learn more about [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s been a pleasure to spend the past few weeks in Kansas City learning more about how non-profit organizations are using crowdfunding in their work, and are shaping how communities understand what crowdfunding represents and what goals it can help them achieve. On January 30th I was delighted to be asked to give the keynote at Kansas City Community Capital Fund&#8217;s Annual Community Development Workshop, at the Kaufman Center. CCF has been pioneering the use of crowdfunding [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today in Kansas City I hosted Fund Camp, a workshop for non-profits on what civic crowdfunding is, how to decide whether it&#8217;s the right path for a project and how to do it effectively. It&#8217;s a format I&#8217;ve been working on for the past year, informed by my research and the issues and challenges I&#8217;ve seen arise across many civic projects. A small group of us gathered at Bauer Studios in the Crossroads neighborhood to talk about four [&#8230;]]]></description>
