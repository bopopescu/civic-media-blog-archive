We are advocating a new internet that strengthens the public domain. The goal is to solve the\u00a0problem that our online lives depend on solutions that take care of shareholders instead of us. PublicSpaces promotes and provides alternative\u00a0solutions. PublicSpaces is a European coalition of public media broadcasters, musea, schools and universities, institutions of cultural heritage\u00a0and health care. We hope that by aggregating the public\u2019s culture in a public space, and that by respecting the public\u2019s right to privacy, we can\u00a0begin to restore some of the promise of the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Geert-Jan Bogaerts is the initiator of the PublicSpaces coalition and also heads the department of Innovation and Digital Media of Dutch public\u00a0broadcaster VPRO, and is also the principal at Raker, a new media consultancy. Geert-Jan has taught at the University of Groningen, lectured\u00a0and headed workshops at various media and marketing companies, and consulted on new media strategies. He is also a journalist and editor\u00a0with 20+ years of experience in financial reporting and international political and economic affairs, and as a correspondent with the EU\/NATO\u00a0in Brussels,
