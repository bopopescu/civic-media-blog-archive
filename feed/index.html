What was once a sleepy beat led by freelancers and activists has become a central topic of coverage for almost every news organization. As the news cycle is transformed by coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic and coverage of the 2020 presidential election ramps up, this beat is again at a critical juncture.

I had seen crusty masterpieces from Julia on the #bread channel. This was back in 2016, and after Julia enthusiastically shared her starter with me, I began caring for and baking my own boules. Google News has me figured out and sporadically presents me with breaking sourdough news, including Scientist Says Bread He Baked From 4,500 Year-Old Yeast Is Delicious. I covet.

It’s reasonable to hypothesize that the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes, would follow a similar pattern. In particular, given President Trump’s attempts to minimize the impacts of the disease, we might expect to see less attention from right wing media than from more mainstream sources popular with [&#8230;]]]></description>

In fact, every other post seems to be related to concerns, updates, and memes about coronavirus &#8212; and with good reason. These are unprecedented times where a health crisis has taken place on a truly global scale, and most of our daily lives have been impacted in some way.

The norms, &#8220;canonical&#8221; readings, and the cutting edge evolve every month! With such an evolving landscape to work within, I relish the opportunities I have to explore something new and different with students in a focused way. This past week I had the great pleasure of doing precisely that at the invitation of the FHNW Institute of Industrial Design as part of their International Design Workshop.

One hope movement leaders express is that a successful movement can change how we think and talk about key social issues. Champions of Occupy argue that one of the movement’s achievements was getting Americans to talk about economic issues in terms of inequality and the power of the 1%. But it’s difficult to quantify claims like this: [&#8230;]]]></description>
